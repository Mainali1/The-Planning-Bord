# **The Planning Bord — Desktop Business Management Software**

### **Inventory, Employee, and Operations Automation System for Small & Medium Businesses**

---

## **1. Project Overview**

Build a **standalone desktop application** for **small and medium-sized businesses**.

It should be distributed as an installer (EXE/Deb, AppImage, MSI, DMG).

The system includes:

* Inventory tracking
* Auto-restock notifications (via Microsoft 365 email)
* Employee management
* Payment & finance management
* Task assignment
* Microsoft 365 integration
* Local database storage
* Optional cloud sync

The software must have a **modern, commercial-grade UI**, run smoothly offline, and integrate automation for everyday business operations.

---

## **2. Core Features & Requirements**

### **Inventory Management System**

Users can manage their full product inventory directly from the desktop app.

Each product includes:

* Item name
* Category
* Supplier/distributor info
* Current quantity
* Minimum desired quantity ("stock limiter")
* Auto-restock quantity

**Automatic Restock Logic (Offline + Online)**

* The desktop app monitors inventory levels automatically.
* When an item falls below the threshold, the app prepares and sends a restock email through Microsoft Outlook (via Graph API).
* Email includes:

  * Business details
  * Item details
  * Quantity required
  * Preferred delivery date

**Optional Dashboard Analytics**

* Fast-moving items
* Low-stock alerts
* Inventory value charts
* Daily/weekly reports

---

## **3. Employee Management System**

The desktop application must include a full HR/employee module:

### **Employee Data Storage**

* Personal details
* Job role, department
* Assigned tools/equipment
* Attendance logs
* Leave requests with optional proof/document upload

### **Anonymous Complaint System**

Employees can submit complaints directly within the app (encrypted, accessible only to admins).

### **Tool & Equipment Tracking**

* Assign tools
* Track return status
* Damage reports

### **Task Assignment System**

* Management assigns tasks to employees
* Desktop notifications (OS native notifications if possible)
* Task states: pending, active, completed, overdue

---

## **4. Payment & Finance Management**

* Track payments to suppliers
* Track employee salary schedules
* Payment history database
* Simple built-in calculator
* Monthly and yearly financial summaries
* Export financial reports (PDF, Excel, CSV)

---

## **5. Microsoft 365 Integration**

Since this is a desktop app, integration must use **Microsoft Graph API** or the user’s signed-in local Outlook client.

Features:

* Send automatic restock emails via Outlook
* Sync files to OneDrive
* Sync tasks with Microsoft To Do / Planner
* Use MS Teams for employee notifications (optional)

---

## **6. Technical Requirements**

### **Desktop Technology Stack (Required)**

You must build the software as a **desktop application**, not a web app.

Recommended options:

#### Option A — **Python Backend + Electron/Tauri Frontend**

* Python handles logic, automation, DB, services
* Electron/Svelte/React for UI
* Packaged as one desktop app

#### Option B — **Full Python Desktop App**

Using:

* PyQt / PySide
* Kivy
* Custom Python desktop framework

#### Option C — **C# .NET (Windows Only)**

* If Windows-only deployment is acceptable
* Smoothest integration with Microsoft services

### **Local Database**

* PostgreSQL (local server or embedded)
* SQLite (recommended for fully offline installs)

### **Automation**

* Use OS-based scheduled tasks or app-based background services
* Daily inventory checks
* Automated email triggers
* Notification popups

### **Security**

* Encrypt local storage
* Use OAuth2 for Microsoft logins
* Optional password/PIN to open the app

---

## **7. Deliverables**

Produce:

* Complete desktop application source code
* Build scripts for Windows/Linux/macOS installers
* Database schema (ERD + SQL migrations)
* API/services architecture documentation
* Microsoft 365 integration modules
* Inventory automation workflow
* UI wireframes for all main screens
* Test suite

---

## **8. Output Format Required from AI Coder**

The AI coder should generate:

### **1. Desktop App Folder Structure**

For Python/Electron or your selected stack.

### **2. Core Backend Logic**

* Inventory services
* Automation engine
* Local DB handlers

### **3. Full UI Component List**

* Inventory UI
* Employee UI
* Task UI
* Dashboard UI
* Settings & Microsoft login UI

### **4. Microsoft Integration Code Examples**

* Outlook email sending
* OneDrive sync
* Graph API auth

### **5. Automation Logic Documentation**

* When restock triggers run
* How emails are prepared
* How notifications work
